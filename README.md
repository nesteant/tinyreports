Simple reporting engine which was created by me when I was a test guy (early 2013) as a proof of concept that we can 
replace Jasper software on one of our projects because they took over 20MB in html format which was unacceptable. 
Also we had to split rendering phase between server and clients which was also implemented in this approach.
Main concern for this approach is the complexity of creating docx document, but it was not required.
Currently this library is moved to the proprietary repository and is maintained by the 3d company itself.
However I'd like to cleanup the code and make it more mature (no one likes code written by a testing guy :) ).
Also it would be nice to try to change model and add support for docx and other formats. And I hope that someday this 
annoying text will be replaced by the normal documentation :)
